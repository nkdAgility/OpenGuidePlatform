# OpenGuidePlatform platform build

This module owns the platform repository build: tool checks, tests, packaging, candidate-sample acceptance and preview publication. It ships in the separate `OpenGuidePlatform-PlatformBuild.zip` archive at the same release version as `OpenGuidePlatform-GuideSite.zip`, which contains the composable GuideSiteBuild stages. The consumer module does not depend on this module.

Run `./build.ps1 -Version 0.0.0-local` from the platform checkout. All runs tests, packages and verifies the distribution, then starts fresh PowerShell processes to build and validate the sample in preview and production using the exact ZIP produced. It does not deploy or publish. Use `-Stage Sample -OutputPath <existing-package-output>` to repeat candidate acceptance independently. `-Stage Release` is explicit and preserves coordinated platform/native-module tag publication.

Sample acceptance also copies the reference site into disposable output, runs Prepare discovery, selects an existing writable guide through the packaged Core module, previews and applies a body correction, verifies other content is unchanged, and builds preview and production. Its `contributor-*/result.json` records the selection and hashes. It does not edit the source sample or consumer repositories.

The same exercise simulates a missing translation in that disposable copy, scaffolds and rediscovers it, applies a complete candidate, and reconciles it against an explicit source commit/path. It checks source/configuration/PDF preservation and both publication targets. Existing sample translated text is a fixture; this verifies mechanics, not translation quality.

`Invoke-PlatformBuild` accepts WorkspaceRoot, Stage, OutputPath and Version explicitly. `Invoke-PlatformBuildOperation` exposes individual platform operations to existing thin `.build/` entry points. Repository identity for release publication is an explicit parameter, independent of the CI runner.

Packaging includes module implementations. Platform tests and the sample are inputs from WorkspaceRoot, not embedded fixtures in the distribution. Actual Azure upload still belongs to the existing workflow adapter; cross-provider deployment and macOS/TeamCity/Azure Pipelines acceptance remain separate gaps, not claims made by this module split.

## Failure explanations

Failing platform checks should throw `New-PlatformBuildFailure -Why <plain-language cause> -HowToFix <concrete repair>`. The test reporter retains those fields in local output, `.processing/platform-tests/<run>/summary.md`, machine-readable findings and the Actions summary/annotation. It handles test, setup and discovery failures. Unclassified exceptions are identified as undiagnosed and retain technical detail; the reporter must never invent a repair from an unfamiliar exception.

The workflow validator explains malformed workflow input and inline-script violations at their source. The Node deprecation notice emitted by third-party Actions is separate from a failed platform check.
