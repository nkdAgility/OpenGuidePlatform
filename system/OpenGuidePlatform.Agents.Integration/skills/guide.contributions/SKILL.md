description: "Create guide or translation-team contributor YAML, apply a reviewed update to one existing contributor, or resolve an edition's credits."
---

Read [Core usage](../USAGE.md), load the consumer policy, and select the declared guide. Contributor data is the only source of guide credits: `data/contributions/<guide>.yml` holds the guide's own people (roles `creator`, `contributor`, `reviewer`, `involved`; creators are the authors) and `data/contributions/<guide>.<lang>.yml` holds one translation team (roles `translator`, `reviewer`). Every record needs `name`, `role` and `contributions` (the edition identifiers it applies to); `weight` orders records and `localizedNames` maps a language code to the name shown in that language. Do not put `author` or `translators` in guide front matter; Prepare blocks them.

Use `New-GuideContributions -WorkspaceRoot $WorkspaceRoot -Policy $policy -GuideId $GuideId -Contributors $Contributors [-Language $Language]` for a new file; `-Language` creates the translation-team file. Existing .yml and .yaml filenames are preserved; two matching files are ambiguous and require reconciliation. New files use .yml.

Preserve supplied URLs, edition references and other contributor metadata; do not invent affiliations, contributions or name spellings. Use `Get-GuideGravatar` only for an address the user supplied for that purpose. When moving names out of guide body text into records, copy them exactly and keep the body acknowledgement.

For an authorized update, read the original bytes and SHA-256 and prepare CandidateYaml with the minimal requested diff. Preserve comments, formatting, contributor order and every unselected record. Apply with `Update-GuideContributions -WorkspaceRoot $WorkspaceRoot -Policy $policy -GuideId $GuideId -ContributorName $Name -ExpectedSha256 $OriginalHash -CandidateYaml $CandidateYaml [-Language $Language]`. The command validates semantic scope and writes the candidate text exactly; it does not reconstruct formatting for you. Review the diff for comment/format preservation.

The update must select exactly one existing name; it cannot rename, add, remove or reorder contributors. A stale hash means re-read and review the changed file, never refresh the hash blindly to bypass the refusal. The cooperative lock cannot prevent edits by programs that ignore it. Use WhatIf to inspect the operation and run the consumer build after an authorized change; Prepare reports invalid roles, unknown editions, duplicates and missing creators or translators. `Get-GuideCredits` shows the authors, contributors and translators a PDF cover will use. Report the changed path and verification result.
